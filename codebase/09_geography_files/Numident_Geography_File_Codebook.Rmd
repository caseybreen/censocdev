\underline{\textbf{Summary and Methodology}}
\end{center}
\vspace{10pt}


The CenSoc-Numident Supplementary Geography File (N = 6,971,468) provides a set of supplementary geographic variables reporting place of birth and/or death for individuals in the CenSoc-Numident mortality file. This file can be linked onto the CenSoc-Numident at the individual-level using HISTID. Individual records may contain only place of birth variables, only place of death variables, or both place of birth and place of death variables.

**Place of death variables:** To construct the place of death variables, we use ZIP code of residence as reported in Social Security Numident death records. We map these ZIP codes onto city, county, state, census region, and country information using a database from the United States Postal Service (USPS) [\textcolor{blue}{(link)}](https://postalpro.usps.com/ZIP_Locale_Detail). For ZIP codes that have been decommissioned, we use a secondary database from UnitedStatesZipCodes.org. Approximately 6.3 million records in the CenSoc-Numident dataset have a ZIP code that can be mapped to state, county, and city information, though some fields may be missing for certain records. Place of death variables are primarily available for individuals who died in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, but some are also present for ZIP codes in Puerto Rico and military bases abroad.


**Place of birth variables:** To construct the place of birth variables, we use 12-character city/county of birth string from Social Security Numident application and claims records. These strings are uncleaned and contain misspellings and other inconsistencies. We mapped these uncleaned strings onto Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) codes using the crosswalk developed for the paper:

|     Black, Dan A., Seth G. Sanders, Evan J. Taylor, and Lowell J. Taylor. 2015. “The Impact of the Great 
|     Migration on Mortality of African Americans: Evidence from  the Deep South.”*American Economic Review.*
|    105(2):477–503. doi: 10.1257/aer.20120642.

To construct other place of birth variable, we mapped the GNIS codes onto city, county, state, and census region information using a database from the U.S. Board on Geographic Names [\textcolor{blue}{(link)}](https://www.usgs.gov/u.s.-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data). Please cite Black et al. (2015) if you are using any of the birthplace geography variables in the file. Birthplace variables are available for nearly 6.5 million records in this dataset. These variables are only available for locations within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. Note that state/country of birth is already included in the CenSoc-Numident (see the variables **bpl** and **bpl_string**) and thus not present in this dataset.

**\huge HISTID**
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Historical unique identifier

**Description**: HISTID is a unique individual-level identifier from IPUMS-USA 1940 Census data. This variable uniquely identifies all records in the dataset and can be used to merge onto the CenSoc-Numident mortality dataset.




\newpage 

**\huge birth_gnis_code **

\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label:** Place of birth, GNIS code

**Description:** birth_gnis_code is a numeric variable that reports a person's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) code for their place of birth. Each GNIS code maps onto physical locations located in the U.S., including longitude and latitude coordinates, physical feature names, counties, and states. For more information on GNIS codes, please see [\textcolor{blue}{https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geographic-names-information-system-gnis}](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geographic-names-information-system-gnis).

Missing values occur if birth city is absent from Numident records, or if the original birth city string was not matched to a GNIS code.

\newpage 

**\huge birth_city **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of birth, city

**Description**: birth_city is a character variable that reports 12-character city/county of birth string from the Numident Application records. This variable is generally uncleaned and unprocessed, and contains spelling errors and naming inconsistencies. 

Missing values occur when birth city is not available in Numident records.







\newpage 

**\huge birth_county **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of birth, county

**Description**: birth_county is a character variable reporting the name of a person's county of birth, as determined by GNIS place of birth. 

Missing values occur if birth city is absent from Numident records, or if the original birth city string was not matched to a GNIS code.

**Note**: In 2022, the state of Connecticut began replacing its eight counties with nine county-equivalent planning regions. This dataset contains the eight "legacy" county regions of Connecticut.





\newpage

**\huge birth_fips **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of birth, county FIPS code

**Description**: birth_fips is a character variable reporting a person's county FIPS code of birth. FIPS codes are 5 digits, of which the first two are the FIPS code of the state to which the county belongs. For a list of modern FIPS codes, see: [\textcolor{blue}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_United\_States\_FIPS\_codes\_by\_county}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_United\_States\_FIPS\_codes\_by\_county). 

Missing values occur if birth city is absent from Numident records, or if the original birth city string was not matched to a GNIS code or county.

**Notes**: FIPS codes appear numeric but can contain leading zeros. County-level FIPS codes in this dataset are always 5 digits. In 2022, the state of Connecticut began replacing its eight counties with nine county-equivalent planning regions. This dataset contain FIPS codes for the the eight "legacy" county regions of Connecticut. FIPS codes occasionally change due to county boundary changes, name changes, etc., and thus codes contained in this dataset may not be completely consistent with external county-level data.





\newpage 

**\huge birth_region **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of birth, census region

**Description**:  birth_region is a character variable reporting a person's census region of birth. For more information on census regions, please see [\textcolor{blue}{https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/guidance-geographies/levels.html}](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/guidance-geographies/levels.html). 

Missing values occur if birth state/country is absent from Numident records or outside of the United States.

\newpage 

**\huge death_zip **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of death, ZIP code

**Description**: death_zip is a character variable that reports 5-digit ZIP code of last residence, as obtained from Numident death records.

Missing values may occur if ZIP code was entered incorrectly in Numident records, if ZIP code is absent from Numident records, or if residence at time of death was outside USPS identifiable ZIP codes (e.g., most locations abroad). 


**Notes**:  ZIP codes appear numeric, but can contain leading zeros. They should always be 5 digits.  Non-identifiable codes such as "XX768" and "00000" may remain in this field. We note that ZIP codes are primarily used for USPS mail delivery purposes, not as geographic units. For a more detailed description of ZIP codes, please see: [\textcolor{blue}{https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics}](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/ZIP-Code-The-Basics).

\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of death, city

**Description**: death_city is a character variable reporting a person's city of death, as determined from the ZIP code of their residence at time of death. For ZIP codes that cross city lines, we report the city where the primary post office for that ZIP code is located. 

Missing values may occur if ZIP code was entered incorrectly in Numident records, if ZIP code is absent from Numident records, or if place of death could not be matched to an identifiable USPS ZIP code.






\newpage 


**\huge death_county **
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}

**Label**: Place of death, county

**Description**: death_county is a character variable reporting the name of a person's county of death, as determined by the ZIP code of their residence at time of death. 

Missing values may occur if ZIP code was entered incorrectly in Numident records, if ZIP code is absent from Numident records, or if ZIP codes could not be matched against USPS records.

**Note**: In 2022, the state of Connecticut began replacing its eight counties with nine county-equivalent planning regions. This dataset contains the eight "legacy" county regions for Connecticut.
