**Summary**: The CenSoc-DMF Version 3.0 Demo dataset (N = 45,907) links the IPUMS 1940 1% census sample to the Death Master File (DMF) dataset, a collection of death records reported to the Social Security Administration. Records were linked using a conservative variant of the ABE method developed by Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson ([2012](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/abe_ageofmassmigration.pdf), [2014](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/abe_assimilation_1.pdf), [2017](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/return-migrants.pdf)).

Note that this demo dataset is not conducive to high-resolution mortality research. We recommend using this file for exploratory and demonstrative purposes. To best conduct research with CenSoc data, researchers may download the full CenSoc-DMF from the CenSoc website, obtain an extract of the 1940 Census from IPUMS-USA, and merge data using on the individual-level, unique identifier HISTID variable. Please adhere to IPUMS citation guidelines when using IPUMS census data.

**\huge weight**
\normalsize

\vspace{12pt}


**Label**: CenSoc Sample Weight[^1]  

**Description**: A post-stratification person-weight to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) totals for persons (1) dying between 1975-2005 (2) dying between ages 65-100. Weights are based on age at death, year of death, sex, and race, and place of birth. Please see the [\textcolor{blue}{technical documentation on weights}](https://censoc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CenSoc_V3_Weights_Technical_Report.pdf) for more information.

[^1]: The IPUMS-USA 1940 1% sample also includes a weight (`perweight`) to account for the 1940 sampling procedure (thus no weights for the 100% complete count 1940 census). For analysis, we recommend using both sets of weights. A final weight can be constructed by multiplying the two weights together.  
```{r, include = F}
weights_tabulated <- censoc_dmf_v3 %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  summarize('Min Weight' = round(min(weight),2), 'Max Weight' = round(max(weight), 2)) %>%
  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id, names_to = "Label", values_to = "Value") %>% 
  select(Value, Label) %>% 
  add_row(Label = "No Weight Assigned", Value = NA) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

The variables below are from the IPUMS-USA 1940 1% census sample. We recommend looking at the terrific documentation on the IPUMS-USA website: [\textcolor{blue}{https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml}](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml)

[^2]: The IPUMS `perweight` accounts for the 1940 sampling procedure to construct the 1% sample, and thus is only available in the 1940 1% sample. For analysis, we recommend using both the IPUMS `perweight` and the CenSoc `weight.` A final weight can be constructed by multiplying the two weights together
[^3]: This variable is only available for sample-line persons (a one-in-twenty sample asked additional questions in the 1940 Census) or those living with their mother.
[^4]: This variable is only available for sample-line persons (a one-in-twenty sample asked additional questions in the 1940 Census) or those living with their father.
[^5]: `educ_yrs` is constructed from the IPUMS `educd` variable but not directly available from IPUMS.  
[^6]: The 1940 Census did not directly inquire about Hispanic ethnicity or origin. This variable is determined by IPUMS using information such as one's birthplace or a parent's birthplace.
