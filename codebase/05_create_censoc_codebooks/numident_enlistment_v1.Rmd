**Summary:** The CenSoc-Numident-WW2-Army-Enlistment (N = 1,163,739) links the full-count 1940 Census to the National Archives’ public release of the Social Security Numident file and the National Archives’ public release of the United States World War II Army Enlistment Records, circa 1938-1946. Records were linked using the standard variant of the ABE method developed by Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson (2012, 2014, 2017). Variables ending in '_numident' are from the Numident file, and those ending in '_enlistment' are from the Army Enlistment file. To merge 1940 Census data with this data set, researchers can obtain a copy of the 1940 Census from IPUMS-USA and link on the individual-level, unique identifier HISTID variable.

**Description**: height_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's height in inches at time of enlistment, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. 

**Note**: Please be aware that instructions on how to use this field on enlistment punch cards varied over time. This field may encode military occupation or other information. Height may have been recorded through about 1943, but height data recorded after February 1943 are likely unreliable. See the [\textcolor{blue}{National Archives' technical documentation on the Amy Serial Number Electronic File}](https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/1263923/content/arcmedia/electronic-records/rg-064/asnf/100.1ND_NC.pdf?download=false) for further information.

**Description**: weight_or_AGCT_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's weight in pounds at time of enlistment or their Army General Classification Test (AGCT) score, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records.

**Note**: Please be aware that instructions on how to use this field on enlistment punch cards varied over time. This field was explicitly used for both weight and AGCT scores, but may also encode military occupation or other information. Weight may have been recorded through about 1943 at some enlistment sites, but the recording of AGCT score instead of weight at some enlistment sites likely began in March 1943. Refer to the [\textcolor{blue}{National Archives' technical documentation on the Amy Serial Number Electronic File}](https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/1263923/content/arcmedia/electronic-records/rg-064/asnf/100.1ND_NC.pdf?download=false) for further information.
