# "Nevertheless, the format of this category of cards changes beginning in 
# column 58. Two new fields are introduced which cause the remaining fields 
# to be off one column when compared to the Enlistment cards. Fortunately, 
# for future interpretation purposes, the E.R.C. cards can be identified by a 
# 3-punch in column 80. Column 80 on the Enlistment cards is not punched."
