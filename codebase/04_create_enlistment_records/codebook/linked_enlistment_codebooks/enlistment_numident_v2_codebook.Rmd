**Summary:** The CenSoc Enlistment-Numident file links 1,692,279 men from World War II era army enlistment records (circa 1938-1947) to mortality records in the Berkeley Unified Numident Mortality Database (BUNMD). The suffix on each variable indicates whether the variable comes from Numident (BUNMD) records or from army enlistment records. For enlistment records that have been independently and additionally linked to the 1940 Census, we include the HISTID identifier variable that researchers may use to merge this dataset with IPUMS 1940 Census data. Matches between datasets were established using a conservative variant of the ABE method developed by Abramitzky, Boustan, and Eriksson ([2012](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/abe_ageofmassmigration.pdf), [2014](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/abe_assimilation_1.pdf), [2017](https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj26066/files/media/file/return-migrants.pdf)).

**Label**: Year of Birth (Numident)

**Description**: byear_numident is a numeric variable reporting a personâ€™s year of birth, as recorded in the Numident death records.

**Note**: The matching algorithm used allows for up to two years of flexibility on birth year, so birth year in the Numident may disagree with birth year in enlistment records. Birth years are discordant by one year in 7.2\% of records, and discordant by two years in 4.1\% of records. Both birth year variables are published in this dataset.

**Description**: residence_state_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's state of residence at time of enlistment, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. This variable is only available for enlistees residing in the United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. The coding schema matches the **detailed** IPUMS-USA birthplace coding schema.

**Description**: residence_county_enlistment is a character variable that reports a person's county of residence at time of enlistment, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. These codes are generally equivalent to FIPS county codes. This variable is only available for enlistees residing in the United States. County is not available for residents of Hawaii and Alaska, which were not yet states. For a complete list of codes, please see: https://aad.archives.gov/aad/popup-codelist.jsp?cl_id=2057&dt=893&c_id=24998. Or, for county codes organized by state, see page 1-65 of [\textcolor{blue}{Nara Compiled Technical Documention.}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/NARAprodstorage/opastorage/live/23/2639/1263923/content/arcmedia/electronic-records/rg-064/asnf/100.1CL_SD.pdf) (Note that state codes in NARA Compiled Technical Documentation are *not* equivalent to either state FIPS codes or IPUMS state codes published in this dataset.)

**Note:** County codes are only unique within states. For example, code 111 refers to Ventura County for residents of California, but refers to Jefferson County for residents of Kentucky. These codes may not align exactly with modern FIPS codes due to county splits, merges, name changes, etc. since the 1940s. County codes within individual states have not been cleaned, and invalid codes may be present.

Place of enlistment may record a state, town, military post, or other ad hoc station of enlistment. For example, places of enlistment in the state of Florida include Florida, Tallahassee, Orlando Air Base, and Municipal Fair Grounds Tampa.

**Label**: Education

**Description**: education_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports an individual's educational attainment at time of enlistment, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records.
Codes are also available at: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/EDUC#codes_section

**Note**: Exact number of years of schooling is unknown for enlistees who did not complete at least one year of high school. Such enlistees were given originally given a code meaning "grammar school", though it is unknown if this corresponds to the modern equivalent of a 5th, 6th, or 8th grade education. Some enlistees with this code may have had little to no actual education. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor, literacy was required of army inductees, but this requirement relaxed as the war effort increased ([\textcolor{blue}{Brandt, 2004}](https://doi.org/10.2307/4140731)). By 1942, the Army accepted illiterate men if they were deemed trainable, though academic standards for admission increased again in 1944 and 1945.

**Label**: Height

**Description**: height_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's height in inches at time of enlistment, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. Height was filtered based on the range of permissible heights for enlistment in the military, 60 - 78 inches ([\textcolor{blue}{Foster et al, 1967}](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA291761.pdf)). 

**Note**: Please be aware that instructions on how to use this field on enlistment punch cards varied over time. This field may encode military occupation or other information depending on time and site of enlistment. We have removed height data for persons who enlisted in March of 1943 or later, as the distribution of this variable changes significantly at that point. However, it is possible that erroneous data remain in this field. See the [\textcolor{blue}{National Archives' technical documentation on the Amy Serial Number Electronic File}](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1263923) for further information.

**\huge weight_before_march_1943_enlistment**
\normalsize
\vspace{12pt}


**Description**: weight_before_march_1943_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's weight in pounds at time of enlistment as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. This variable is only available for enlistees who enlisted before March of 1943. Weight is filtered to a minimum of 105 pounds, the minimum permissible weight for a 60-inch-tall enlistee ([\textcolor{blue}{Foster et al, 1967}](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA291761.pdf)). While there was no clear maximum allowable body weight for army enlistees, we have removed values of over 500.

**Note**: On enlistment punchcards, the field used to record weight was also used for Army General Classification Test (AGCT) scores, and may also encode military occupation or other information. Weight may have been recorded through 1943 at some enlistment sites, but the recording of AGCT score instead of weight at many enlistment sites likely began in March 1943. Because of this ambiguity, we only make this variable available for enlistees who enlisted before March 1943. 
Refer to the [\textcolor{blue}{National Archives' technical documentation on the Amy Serial Number Electronic File}](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/1263923) for further information. For enlistees who enlisted in March 1943 and later, we have created an additional variable called **weight_or_AGCT_enlistment**.

```{r, include = F}
weight_plot <- data_records %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight_before_march_1943_enlistment)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(100,500,5)) +

**Label**: Weight (Pounds) at Enlistment or AGCT Score

**Description**: weight_or_AGCT_enlistment is a numeric variable that reports a person's weight in pounds at time of enlistment or their Army General Classification Test (AGCT) score, as reported in the World War II Army Enlistment Records. This variable is only available for enlistees who enlisted in March 1943 or later.  We have removed zeros and values above 500, which likely exceed the maximum realistic body weights and AGCT scores, but otherwise leave the data in this field unfiltered and unsorted.

**Note**: On enlistment punch cards, the field used to record weight was also used for Army General Classification Test (AGCT) scores, and may also encode military occupation or other information. Weight may have been recorded through 1943 at some enlistment sites, but the recording of AGCT score instead of weight at many enlistment sites likely began in March 1943. Because of this ambiguity, we created this variable for persons enlisted in March 1943 or later, which may contain weight or AGCT or other information.  
Refer to the [\textcolor{blue}{National Archives' technical documentation on the Amy Serial Number Electronic File}](https://catalog.archives.gov/OpaAPI/media/1263923/content/arcmedia/electronic-records/rg-064/asnf/100.1ND_NC.pdf?download=false) for further information. For enlistees prior to March 1943, we used the information recorded in this field to create the **weight_before_march_1943_enlistment** variable.
